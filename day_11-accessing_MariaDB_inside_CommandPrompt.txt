The following are Command Prompt/Terminal Commands to help you access the MariaDB.
Before running the commands, make sure you have installed XAMPP and you have opened localhost server in your computer.
To open Localhost server:
 - launch the XAMPP control panel
 - go to your favorite web browser and type localhost

Run the following commands in your CMD/Terminal to access the MariaDB:
1. cd C:\filepath\xampp (change directory to where you have installed your xampp)
2. cd mysql
3. cd bin
4. mysql -u root

If you the 4th command and everything is set, i.e localhost/phpmyadmin server is on, you will see a message welcoming you to MariaDB. You are now ready to run your SQL queries/commands using the MariaDB. 
Remember SQL commands end with semi colon as a standard rule.
You can start with SHOW DATABESES; (to view databases that are inside phpmyadmin).
