# 66_DAYS_OF_DATA
This is the repository where I will be uploading all my 66 Days of Data Challenge Work.  For the challenge, I will be learning, unlearning and relearning data handling concepts (Statistical Data Analysis and Data Science) each day for 66 days. In the very least, I should learn for at least 5 minutes a day.
